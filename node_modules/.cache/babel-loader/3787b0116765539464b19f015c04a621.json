Smell is one of our most primitive and powerful senses. The part of the brain that processes smel - called the olfactory bulb - is directly connected to the part of the brain that processes danger and emotion &ndash; called the amygdala. This means that smell is a very quick way of<br />\\naffecting our emotional responses.</p>\\n\\n<p>Different smells can serve different purposes. You may have already tried using a soothing smell to help to relax and calm yourself. If you are having a flashback though, and need to<br />\\ncome back to the present moment, then it is helpful to use a strong smell &ndash; for this purpose it does not even have to be a smell you like. To be useful, you will need to have the smell<br />\\nwith you wherever you go.</p>\\n\\n<p>The first step to grounding yourself with smell will be to pick a grounding smell. For this sensory grounding exercise we want to use a strong smell to bring you back to the present<br />\\nmoment. A great source of smells are the small bottles of essential oil which you can buy from a chemist or pharmacist. Other common sources of smells are natural herbs and<br />\\nspices, or perfumes. The strongest smells tend to be traditional smelling salts that contain ammonia. Other strong smells include eucalyptus, tea-tree, or mint.</p>\\n\\n<p>The instructions for this exercise will start in a moment.

The fight-or-flight response is an automatic bodily reaction which is designed to get our body ready to cope with danger.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of these changes is that our muscles tense to prepare for action. If there is a real danger this means that we are more ready to run away from a danger at a moment&rsquo;s notice or, if we can&rsquo;t run, then we are ready to fight. This is called the fight or flight reaction.</p>\\n\\n<p>Unfortunately what we know is that when we have PTSD our fight-or-flight reaction is too sensitive - it often goes off even when there is no danger. Progressive muscle relaxation is a great way to correct this unhelpful reaction of the fight or- flight response. Deliberately relaxing the muscles in the body signals to the mind that you are safe, that there is no danger, and that you are safe to relax once again.</p>\\n',type:'audio',file:'IMG_2021414_8409.mp3',thum_img:'IMG_2021414_8407.jpg',created_at:'2021-04-14T08:40:25.000Z'},{id:36,title:'Mindfulness of Breath',description:'<p>Different things can happen when we practice mindfulness for longer periods.

The purpose of the exercise is to practice a longer mindfulness of breath, and see<br />\\nwhat comes up. If it doesn&rsquo;t sound like that&rsquo;s for you at the moment that&rsquo;s OK, you can always come back to the exercise at a later time.</p>\\n\\n<p>Remember, as with all of our practices our mindset is one of curiosity. Practice experiencing each breath as a new breath, as if you hadn&rsquo;t felt the one before. Really noticing how it&rsquo;s moving all of your parts of your body. Everyone&#39;s different &ndash; some people find it relaxing, and others notice boredom or irritation, or impatience arising. Sometimes we can feel that sense of wanting to move on to the next moment, wanting it to be over. And these moments are an opportunity to notice that we&rsquo;re having a reaction to the neutralness or indifference of that moment.

One of the ways we can practice mindfulness is to place our attention in our bodies. Much of the time, we can be so &lsquo;stuck in our head&rsquo; that we feel disconnected from our bodies, even though they are with us all the time. The body scan exercise helps us learn to feel more connected, by using the body as an anchor for our attention. So the purpose of the body scan is to have an introduction to sensing and feeling, rather than thinking.</p>\\n\\n<p>During this exercise you can imagine that your attention is a spotlight that illuminates different parts of the body as you shift your focus. As the light shines on a particular<br />\\npart, notice the feeling that comes up, whether it&rsquo;s a warmth, a tingling sensation, or even nothing at all. Not so much thinking about what&rsquo;s there, but just feeling it.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nRemember: your attitude in these exercises is to bring an open curiosity and interest. There&rsquo;s no right or wrong, your intention is just to notice whatever is there. And it&rsquo;s OK if<br />\\nthere is no particular sensation &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have to go searching or think about it.</p>\\n\\n<p>This exercise will take about ten to twelve minutes, and you will be guided where to focus<br />\\nyour attention throughout. Just feel whatever comes up. Sooner or later your mind will wander; whenever that happens, remember that&rsquo;s OK, and that&rsquo;s normal. If you notice<br />\\nsensations that are painful or uncomfortable then at those moments you have a choice about whether to pay attention to parts of your body that feel more comfortable, or to the<br />\\ninstructions of the body scan. Take care of what feels OK for you and work within the limits of your own body.</p>\\n',type:'audio',file:'IMG_2021414_82513.mp3',thum_img:'IMG_2021414_82510.jpg',created_at:'2021-04-14T08:25:30.000Z'},{id:33,title:'Recovering from a nightmare',description:'<p>Many people with PTSD have frequent nightmares.

This<br />\\n&lsquo;works&rsquo; for some things in our lives &ndash; think about how you avoid foods you don&rsquo;t like. And<br />\\nsometimes we try to do the same with our feelings &ndash; unpleasantness might come up and<br />\\nwe try to avoid it. But even if you keep pushing it away, it&rsquo;s like a boomerang and it just<br />\\ncomes back. And sometimes that struggle of pushing things away, and being distressed<br />\\nthat they don&rsquo;t stay away, can be distressing.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nOne way of thinking about this is to think about the difference between pain and suffering.<br />\\nWe can think of the thing we don&rsquo;t like as &lsquo;pain&rsquo; &ndash; and it&rsquo;s understandable and unavoidable<br />\\nto experience dislike and &lsquo;pain&rsquo; in our lives. Then we think of the struggle with our pain as<br />\\nthe suffering.

Mindfulness is one way of helping us to learn how to<br />\\nunhook from these difficult thoughts and feelings.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nInterestingly, human beings can be really good at unhooking from sounds. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve<br />\\nbeen in a busy place, like a caf&eacute;, and tuned out sounds around you when you&rsquo;ve been tuned<br />\\nin to a conversation with a friend. It&#39;s only when there&rsquo;s a pause in the conversation that<br />\\nyou become aware of all the noise around you.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nEqually, sounds can be really good at hooking us in: imagine you&rsquo;re watching tv and some<br />\\npeople start making noise outside. It can be hard, but not impossible, to unhook from that<br />\\nnoise.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nThe point is that we can consider sounds &ndash; like thoughts &ndash; as sensations that come and<br />\\ngo. Learning to hear sounds as &lsquo;just sounds&rsquo; can help us to experience our thoughts as &lsquo;just<br />\\nthoughts&rsquo;. In this exercise, your intention is to spend about 10 minutes noticing sounds and<br />\\nthoughts. Like all of our exercises, we&rsquo;re not trying to &lsquo;achieve&rsquo; anything, we&rsquo;re spending<br />\\ntime experiencing these sensations.

Instructions: The exercise consists of 3 sections (1 minute per section):</span></p>\\n\\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">1. Awareness: Ask yourself the question: How am I doing right now? Focus your attention on your inner perception. Notice which thoughts, feelings and physical sensations you are experiencing. Try to translate your experiences into words.

Smell is one of our most primitive and powerful senses. The part of the brain that processes smel - called the olfactory bulb - is directly connected to the part of the brain that processes danger and emotion &ndash; called the amygdala. This means that smell is a very quick way of<br />\\naffecting our emotional responses.</p>\\n\\n<p>Different smells can serve different purposes. You may have already tried using a soothing smell to help to relax and calm yourself. If you are having a flashback though, and need to<br />\\ncome back to the present moment, then it is helpful to use a strong smell &ndash; for this purpose it does not even have to be a smell you like. To be useful, you will need to have the smell<br />\\nwith you wherever you go.</p>\\n\\n<p>The first step to grounding yourself with smell will be to pick a grounding smell. For this sensory grounding exercise we want to use a strong smell to bring you back to the present<br />\\nmoment. A great source of smells are the small bottles of essential oil which you can buy from a chemist or pharmacist. Other common sources of smells are natural herbs and<br />\\nspices, or perfumes. The strongest smells tend to be traditional smelling salts that contain ammonia. Other strong smells include eucalyptus, tea-tree, or mint.</p>\\n\\n<p>The instructions for this exercise will start in a moment.

The fight-or-flight response is an automatic bodily reaction which is designed to get our body ready to cope with danger.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of these changes is that our muscles tense to prepare for action. If there is a real danger this means that we are more ready to run away from a danger at a moment&rsquo;s notice or, if we can&rsquo;t run, then we are ready to fight. This is called the fight or flight reaction.</p>\\n\\n<p>Unfortunately what we know is that when we have PTSD our fight-or-flight reaction is too sensitive - it often goes off even when there is no danger. Progressive muscle relaxation is a great way to correct this unhelpful reaction of the fight or- flight response. Deliberately relaxing the muscles in the body signals to the mind that you are safe, that there is no danger, and that you are safe to relax once again.</p>\\n',\n    type: 'audio',\n    file: 'IMG_2021414_8409.mp3',\n    thum_img: 'IMG_2021414_8407.jpg',\n    created_at: '2021-04-14T08:40:25.000Z',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 36,\n    title: 'Mindfulness of Breath',\n    description:\n      '<p>Different things can happen when we practice mindfulness for longer periods.

The purpose of the exercise is to practice a longer mindfulness of breath, and see<br />\\nwhat comes up. If it doesn&rsquo;t sound like that&rsquo;s for you at the moment that&rsquo;s OK, you can always come back to the exercise at a later time.</p>\\n\\n<p>Remember, as with all of our practices our mindset is one of curiosity. Practice experiencing each breath as a new breath, as if you hadn&rsquo;t felt the one before. Really noticing how it&rsquo;s moving all of your parts of your body. Everyone&#39;s different &ndash; some people find it relaxing, and others notice boredom or irritation, or impatience arising. Sometimes we can feel that sense of wanting to move on to the next moment, wanting it to be over. And these moments are an opportunity to notice that we&rsquo;re having a reaction to the neutralness or indifference of that moment.

One of the ways we can practice mindfulness is to place our attention in our bodies. Much of the time, we can be so &lsquo;stuck in our head&rsquo; that we feel disconnected from our bodies, even though they are with us all the time. The body scan exercise helps us learn to feel more connected, by using the body as an anchor for our attention. So the purpose of the body scan is to have an introduction to sensing and feeling, rather than thinking.</p>\\n\\n<p>During this exercise you can imagine that your attention is a spotlight that illuminates different parts of the body as you shift your focus. As the light shines on a particular<br />\\npart, notice the feeling that comes up, whether it&rsquo;s a warmth, a tingling sensation, or even nothing at all. Not so much thinking about what&rsquo;s there, but just feeling it.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nRemember: your attitude in these exercises is to bring an open curiosity and interest. There&rsquo;s no right or wrong, your intention is just to notice whatever is there. And it&rsquo;s OK if<br />\\nthere is no particular sensation &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have to go searching or think about it.</p>\\n\\n<p>This exercise will take about ten to twelve minutes, and you will be guided where to focus<br />\\nyour attention throughout. Just feel whatever comes up. Sooner or later your mind will wander; whenever that happens, remember that&rsquo;s OK, and that&rsquo;s normal. If you notice<br />\\nsensations that are painful or uncomfortable then at those moments you have a choice about whether to pay attention to parts of your body that feel more comfortable, or to the<br />\\ninstructions of the body scan.

This<br />\\n&lsquo;works&rsquo; for some things in our lives &ndash; think about how you avoid foods you don&rsquo;t like. And<br />\\nsometimes we try to do the same with our feelings &ndash; unpleasantness might come up and<br />\\nwe try to avoid it. But even if you keep pushing it away, it&rsquo;s like a boomerang and it just<br />\\ncomes back. And sometimes that struggle of pushing things away, and being distressed<br />\\nthat they don&rsquo;t stay away, can be distressing.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nOne way of thinking about this is to think about the difference between pain and suffering.<br />\\nWe can think of the thing we don&rsquo;t like as &lsquo;pain&rsquo; &ndash; and it&rsquo;s understandable and unavoidable<br />\\nto experience dislike and &lsquo;pain&rsquo; in our lives. Then we think of the struggle with our pain as<br />\\nthe suffering. And the suffering results from &lsquo;trying to get rid of &rsquo; the unpleasant experience.<br />\\nOne thing that we&rsquo;re practicing with mindfulness is to ask the question &ldquo;Can we sit<br />\\nwith difficulty, and try and bring friendliness and curiosity to it?&rdquo;.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nSo in this exercise, your intention is to spend about ten minutes &lsquo;being with&rsquo; a difficulty.<br />\\nWe&rsquo;re going to treat it like an experiment. We&rsquo;re going to take a curious stance: we&rsquo;re<br />\\nnot trying to achieve anything. Instead of reacting to the distressing thing in a typical<br />\\nunhelpful way, we&rsquo;re going to see how we might be with it in a more friendly way.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nObviously, we don&rsquo;t want to choose something that&rsquo;s a ten out of ten distressing, so perhaps<br />\\nchoose a minor disagreement, or something that&rsquo;s been niggling away at you for a while.<br />\\nAnd we&rsquo;re going to ask the question &ldquo;what&rsquo;s it like to just be with this?&rdquo;.

Mindfulness is one way of helping us to learn how to<br />\\nunhook from these difficult thoughts and feelings.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nInterestingly, human beings can be really good at unhooking from sounds. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve<br />\\nbeen in a busy place, like a caf&eacute;, and tuned out sounds around you when you&rsquo;ve been tuned<br />\\nin to a conversation with a friend. It&#39;s only when there&rsquo;s a pause in the conversation that<br />\\nyou become aware of all the noise around you.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nEqually, sounds can be really good at hooking us in: imagine you&rsquo;re watching tv and some<br />\\npeople start making noise outside. It can be hard, but not impossible, to unhook from that<br />\\nnoise.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nThe point is that we can consider sounds &ndash; like thoughts &ndash; as sensations that come and<br />\\ngo. Learning to hear sounds as &lsquo;just sounds&rsquo; can help us to experience our thoughts as &lsquo;just<br />\\nthoughts&rsquo;. In this exercise, your intention is to spend about 10 minutes noticing sounds and<br />\\nthoughts. Like all of our exercises, we&rsquo;re not trying to &lsquo;achieve&rsquo; anything, we&rsquo;re spending<br />\\ntime experiencing these sensations. We&rsquo;re not trying to react to them, but rather bringing<br />\\na friendly awareness to them. Be open and curious to what you experience, to whatever<br />\\ncomes up.</p>\\n',\n    type: 'video',\n    file: 'IMG_2021318_131812.mp4',\n    thum_img: 'IMG_2021323_212840.jpg',\n    created_at: '2021-01-27T14:18:03.000Z',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 28,\n    title: 'Mindfulness in Everyday Life',\n    description:\n      '<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nNow that you have had some practice with a variety of mindfulness exercises, we want to<br />\\nbuild a bridge between your mindfulness practice and your everyday life.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nWhy do we want to make mindful awareness a part of our lives? Most people come to<br />\\nmindfulness because we&rsquo;ve struggled in some way &ndash; and because it&rsquo;s normal to struggle at<br />\\ntimes in our lives. We spend much of our time on autopilot &ndash; with our minds reaching for,<br />\\nor worrying about the future, or dwelling on the past. Mindfulness gives us an alternative<br />\\nto being on autopilot. When we bring an awareness, we feel alive. We learn to show up for<br />\\nour lives.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nIn this exercise, your intention is to spend just a few minutes or so to do three things:<br />\\nfirstly, to notice what&rsquo;s here in this moment, in your thoughts, feelings, and body; and<br />\\nthen secondly, focusing your attention on your breath; and then finally, expanding your<br />\\nawareness to this moment. And this can be a helpful way of steadying ourselves in the<br />\\nmidst of discomfort. This simple exercise is a way of getting out of your head and back into<br />\\nyour body, touching the present moment again.</p>\\n',\n    type: 'video',\n    file: 'IMG_2021318_131927.mp4',\n    thum_img: 'IMG_2021323_212852.jpg',\n    created_at: '2021-01-27T14:02:40.000Z',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 27,\n    title: 'Mindful Attention',\n    description:\n      '<p>Mindful attention is an exercise in which you can train yourself to bring your attention<br />\\nback to the present moment.

The Three Minute Breathing Space exercise can be used as an effective practice to integrate mindfulness into daily life. A structural implementation of the exercise can be achieved by using a timer at fixed moments during the day. In this way, the exercise can become automatized. NB: During this exercise, your attention might get distracted by certain thoughts or feelings. Simply notice this. You can decide to observe these thoughts and feelings for a while and then return your attention to your breath or your body. Instructions: The exercise consists of 3 sections (1 minute per section):</span></p>\\n\\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">1. Awareness: Ask yourself the question: How am I doing right now? Focus your attention on your inner perception. Notice which thoughts, feelings and physical sensations you are experiencing. Try to translate your experiences into words. For example: &ldquo;there are self-critical thoughts&rdquo; or &ldquo;I notice I am tensed&rdquo;. What are you feeling in your body? Allow yourself to feel what you are feeling in the current moment. Accept it. You can tell yourself that it&rsquo;s okay what you&rsquo;re feeling, whatever is there is fine just the way it is.</span></p>\\n\\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">2. Breathing: Next focus your full attention on your breath. Follow the breathing with your attention.</span></p>\\n\\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">3. Expansion of attention: Allow your attention to expand to the rest of your body. Feel how your breath moves throughout your whole body. With every in-breath you can feel how your body expands a little and with each out-breath how it shrinks a little.</span></p>\\n',\n    type: 'image',\n    file: 'IMG_2020617_1095.jpg',\n    thum_img: 'IMG_2020617_1094.jpg',\n    created_at: '2020-06-15T09:16:16.000Z',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 21,\n    title: '5 Senses',\n    description:\n      '<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can relax almost anywhere, provided that you can sit or lie comfortably without being disturbed</span></p>\\n',\n    type: 'audio',\n    file: 'IMG_2020618_181159.mp3',\n    thum_img: 'IMG_2020618_181159.jpg',\n    created_at: '2020-06-08T19:44:47.000Z',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 18,\n    title: 'Relaxed Breathing with balloon imagery',\n    description:\n      '<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The aim of this relaxed breathing exercise is to promote relaxation while staying grounded...</span></p>\\n',\n    type: 'audio',\n    file: 'IMG_2020617_102052.mp3',\n    thum_img: 'IMG_2020615_9532.jpg',\n    created_at: '2020-05-30T18:21:41.000Z',\n  },\n];\n\nexport default function Exercise() {\n  const match = useRouteMatch(ROUTES.EXERCISE_DETAILS_PAGE);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"inner_page mb-5\">\n      {match ?
