The world around us (and the thoughts in our heads) trigger emotional reactions all the time. Much of what we do is motivated by a desire to change or maintain a feeling-state &ndash; to hold on to good feelings or to avoid bad feelings.</p>\\n\\n<p>Emotions make us want to act, and different emotions guide us towards different kinds of actions.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Emotions as problems</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>In some ways it is odd to think of emotions as being a problem. After all, it is a normal human experience to feel them, and they are often a good guide to what we need to do. Feeling nervous can make us take care, feeling guilty can guide us to repair any damage we may have caused, and feeling that we have fallen out of love can guide us to end an unhappy relationship. Emotions can cause us to<strong>&nbsp;<em>suffer</em></strong>&nbsp;though, and that is when we see them as being problematic.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>When are emotions a problem?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Some people prefer to view emotions as a guide rather than a problem. When they are feeling something strong, they might ask&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;What is this feeling telling me to do?&rdquo;, or &ldquo;What does my heart (or gut) tell me?&rdquo;</em>. With the proviso that we are not saying anything is &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; with having emotions, psychologists have some &lsquo;rules of thumb&rsquo; about when emotions can become problematic:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Strong feelings go on for too long</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>For example, when the (normal) &lsquo;baby blues&rsquo; after giving birth turn into post-natal depression. Or when (normal) strong feelings of grief persist for many years after the loss of a loved one.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>They interfere with our ability to live our lives</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>For example, feeling so anxious that we are scared to leave the house or meet people. Or feeling so sad and demotivated that we can&rsquo;t be bothered to do anything at all.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>They are out of proportion to what most other people would feel in that situation</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>For example, a certain amount of shyness is normal but some people feel such paralyzing anxiety when they are around other people that it is labelled &lsquo;social anxiety disorder&rsquo; (and can be successfully treated).</p>\\n\\n<p>After a traumatic event it is common to feel &lsquo;wary&rsquo; and &lsquo;on guard&rsquo;, but some people who develop a condition called post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experience extreme fear that may persist for many years.</p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n',\n  file: 'IMG_2021125_101433.jpg',\n  thum_img: '',\n  type: 'image',\n  created_at: '2021-01-25T10:14:34.000Z'\n}, {\n  id: 30,\n  topic: 'Emotions',\n  title: 'Understanding emotions',\n  description: '<p>Another way of thinking about the effects of emotions is to sort them into problems of &lsquo;too much&rsquo;, &lsquo;too little&rsquo;, and &lsquo;too difficult to control&rsquo;:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>When we feel too much</strong></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>We might feel too scared in certain situations, or when confronted with certain things.

Included is a selection of tips that can help you maintain your well-being and manage your worry. These can help you to:</span></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Maintain balance in your life.</strong> Psychologists think that well-being comes from living a life with a balance of activities that give you feelings of pleasure, achievement, and closeness. Remember that we&rsquo;re social animals &ndash; we need connections to thrive and flourish. We would recommend trying to do at least some activities that are social and involve other people. In times like these you might have to find some creative ways to do social things at a distance. For example, by keeping in touch online or by phone.</span></li>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Practice identifying whether your worry is &lsquo;real problem&rsquo; worry, or &lsquo;hypothetical worry&rsquo;.</strong>&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re experiencing lots of hypothetical worry, then it&rsquo;s important to remind yourself that your mind is not focusing on a problem that you can solve right now, and then to find ways to let the worry go and focus on something else.</span></li>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Practice postponing your worry.</strong> Worry is insistent &ndash; it can make you feel as though you have to engage with it right now. But you can experiment with postponing hypothetical worry. In practice, this means deliberately setting aside time each day to let yourself worry (e.g. 30 minutes at the end of each day). It can feel like an odd thing to do at first! It also means that for the other 23.5 hours in the day you try to let go of the worry until you get to your &lsquo;worry time&rsquo;.</span></li>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Practice mindfulness.</strong> Learning and practicing mindfulness&nbsp;can help us to let go of worries and bring ourselves back to the present moment.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Final tips to help manage anxiety or worry</strong></span></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Set a routine.</strong> If you are spending more time at home it is important to continue with a regular routine.</span></li>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Stay mentally and physically active.</strong> When you plan your daily timetable have a go at including activities that keep both your mind and body active.</span></li>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Practice gratitude.</strong> At times of uncertainty, developing a gratitude practice can help you to connect with moments of joy, aliveness, and pleasure. At the end of each day take time to reflect on what you are thankful for today.</span></li>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Notice and limit worry triggers.</strong> As the health situation develops it can feel like we need to constantly follow the news or check social media for updates. However, you might notice this also triggers your worry and anxiety.

In other words, mindfulness involves directing attention to the experience in the present moment and a non-evaluative observation of that experience.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>INFORMAL EXERCISES</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Mindfulness interventions also involve informal exercises that aim to enhance mindful awareness during everyday activities. They require a single focus of attention and the ability to gently turn back to the object of attention following distraction. The object of attention can be anything, ranging from a conversation with a colleague to eating lunch. We predict that these exercises are particularly useful when attempting to integrate mindfulness at the workplace because they do not necessarily require additional time or environmental changes. Note that there are virtually endless examples of informal practices, which makes it impossible to list and describe them all. We have attempted to categorize the most important informal exercises and briefly explain them in the context of work.</p>\\n',\n  file: 'IMG_2020622_205523.jpg',\n  thum_img: '',\n  type: 'image',\n  created_at: '2020-06-22T20:55:24.000Z'\n}, {\n  id: 19,\n  topic: 'Mindfulness',\n  title: 'Awareness during social interaction',\n  description: '<p>Practicing mindfulness in a social context involves interacting with the other person(s) as a single point of focus. Instead of multi-tasking during a conversation with a colleague or thinking about what to say next, attention is paid to the current conversation. In contrast to identifying with one&rsquo;s own assumptions and reacting impulsively, mindfulness requires an open, non-judgemental attitude during the conversation&nbsp;characterized by deep listening, perspective&nbsp; taking, and allowing the other to respond. Moreover, mindfulness during social interaction can involve speaking with awareness. Examples include pausing before speaking, monitoring one&rsquo;s thoughts, and considering the effect of speaking them out loud. Practicing awareness during social interaction is an exercise that can easily be implemented into one&rsquo;s everyday life.</p>\\n',\n  file: 'IMG_2020615_102853.jpg',\n  thum_img: '',\n  type: 'image',\n  created_at: '2020-06-15T10:28:54.000Z'\n}, {\n  id: 18,\n  topic: 'Mindfulness',\n  title: 'Awareness of impulsive and reactive patterns',\n  description: '<p>Many daily patterns of thinking and behaviour are habitual (unconscious) reactions to experiences or events. Failing to perform well may immediately trigger negative self-critical thoughts and judgments. The experience of sadness can result in a direct attempt to push away the unwanted feeling. Receiving a snide remark from a colleague may cause one to raise the voice and say things that he/she might regret afterwards. In all these examples, automatic patterns guide the behaviour. Mindfulness requires awareness of these experiences as they arise during the day.</p>\\n\\n<p>While it may be difficult to become aware of these experiences before the onset of an impulsive reaction, becoming aware of them afterwards can also be beneficial because it may enhance detection of similar patterns in the future.</p>\\n',\n  file: 'IMG_2020615_102712.jpg',\n  thum_img: '',\n  type: 'image',\n  created_at: '2020-06-15T10:27:14.000Z'\n}, {\n  id: 17,\n  topic: 'Mindfulness',\n  title: 'Body awareness',\n  description: '<p>The awareness of the body can be implemented in daily life by paying attention to the body regularly throughout the day in various circumstances.

One can, for instance, implement daily moments of mindful awareness by setting an alarm at random intervals to disrupt repetitive movements or become aware of one&rsquo;s posture.</p>\\n',\n  file: 'IMG_2020615_102445.jpg',\n  thum_img: '',\n  type: 'image',\n  created_at: '2020-06-15T10:24:45.000Z'\n}, {\n  id: 16,\n  topic: 'Mindfulness',\n  title: 'Awareness of routine activities',\n  description: '<p>Routine activities are activities performed regularly, often daily. Most routine activities require little conscious attention because they are highly automatized. Examples include taking a shower, driving or walking to the workplace, or consuming lunch. The idea is to focus attention fully on the activity; the body movements, the sight, the sensations. When thoughts or other distractions emerge, one notices them and brings back attention to the task at hand. For instance, when eating mindfully, one eats slowly, directing attention mainly to the experience in the present moment, which includes physical movements, the taste and smell of the food, and the like. Thus, rather than doing multiple things at the same time (such as reading while eating, talking on the phone while driving home, thinking about work while taking a shower), one adopts a single focus of attention.</p>\\n\\n<p>As part of mindfulness training programs, participants are encouraged to pick a few of these routine activities and to practice performing them in a mindful way. Since it is not time-consuming and involves activities that are performed daily, this exercise can easily be implemented into one&rsquo;s workday. Participants may pick activities, such as being mindful while having lunch, being mindful while walking to the copy machine, or being mindful while driving home from work.</p>\\n',\n  file: 'IMG_2020615_101216.jpg',\n  thum_img: 'IMG_2020615_101217.jpg',\n  type: 'image',\n  created_at: '2020-06-15T09:41:51.000Z'\n}, {\n  id: 5,\n  topic: 'Communication',\n  title: 'Effective Commuinication',\n  description: '<p>Effective communication is about more than just exchanging information.

break-ups. It is therefore, crucial that efforts at resolving the conflict be well planned. Planning how to effectively resolve a conflict with a partner should take into consideration a number of important factors which are as follows:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Choosing a time and place when both parties will be free of distractions</li>\\n\\t<li>Reflect on one&rsquo;s concerns before sharing them</li>\\n\\t<li>Taking responsibility for one&rsquo;s own role in the conflict</li>\\n\\t<li>Avoid blaming but share the impact of the conflict</li>\\n\\t<li>Being cognisant of the language used and tone of voice and what it communicates</li>\\n\\t<li>Resolving a conflict is not a contest and therefore there&rsquo;s no need for a winner</li>\\n\\t<li>Ensuring congruence between verbal and non-verbal cues</li>\\n\\t<li>Listening with empathy and allowing the partner to speak with no interruption</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Despite one&rsquo;s best intentions, the discussion may not yield solutions but elicit negative emotions; it is worthwhile to take a timeout and calm down before continuing with the discussion. Once the discussion resumes, a review of the goals helps one to focus on the important issues. Conflict resolution is all about understanding more than defeating.

Although necessary, this not automatic but instead requires practice and hard work.</p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<p>Two people in a relationship will likely have different communication styles; and the manner in which opinions are shared should take the different styles into consideration.

However, sometimes worry gets out of control. When worries arise with no provocation or are disproportionate to the situation, a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder is often made. When such anxiety consumes too much mental activity or interferes with activities and performance it is seen as a mental illness.</p>\\n\\n<p>Individuals with such a diagnosis, despite attempts to the contrary, cannot shake their feelings of dread in anticipation of some bad outcome even if they realize that it is unfounded. They often expect things to go wrong.</p>\\n\\n<p>Their anxiety also impacts them physiologically, where they are often in a state of agitation, struggle to fall or stay asleep. They may even have headaches, palpitations, hot flushes, trembling, light-headedness, or fatigue.</p>\\n\\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\\n\\n<h2><strong><u>Children and Anxiety</u></strong></h2>\\n\\n<p>Anxiety disorders are also present in children. Often, their first worries revolve around separation from their caregivers. They also worry about any of a number of things that they cannot control.

The world around us (and the thoughts in our heads) trigger emotional reactions all the time. Much of what we do is motivated by a desire to change or maintain a feeling-state &ndash; to hold on to good feelings or to avoid bad feelings.</p>\\n\\n<p>Emotions make us want to act, and different emotions guide us towards different kinds of actions.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Emotions as problems</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>In some ways it is odd to think of emotions as being a problem. After all, it is a normal human experience to feel them, and they are often a good guide to what we need to do. Feeling nervous can make us take care, feeling guilty can guide us to repair any damage we may have caused, and feeling that we have fallen out of love can guide us to end an unhappy relationship. Emotions can cause us to<strong>&nbsp;<em>suffer</em></strong>&nbsp;though, and that is when we see them as being problematic.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>When are emotions a problem?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Some people prefer to view emotions as a guide rather than a problem. When they are feeling something strong, they might ask&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;What is this feeling telling me to do?&rdquo;, or &ldquo;What does my heart (or gut) tell me?&rdquo;</em>. With the proviso that we are not saying anything is &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; with having emotions, psychologists have some &lsquo;rules of thumb&rsquo; about when emotions can become problematic:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Strong feelings go on for too long</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>For example, when the (normal) &lsquo;baby blues&rsquo; after giving birth turn into post-natal depression. Or when (normal) strong feelings of grief persist for many years after the loss of a loved one.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>They interfere with our ability to live our lives</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>For example, feeling so anxious that we are scared to leave the house or meet people. Or feeling so sad and demotivated that we can&rsquo;t be bothered to do anything at all.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>They are out of proportion to what most other people would feel in that situation</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>For example, a certain amount of shyness is normal but some people feel such paralyzing anxiety when they are around other people that it is labelled &lsquo;social anxiety disorder&rsquo; (and can be successfully treated).</p>\\n\\n<p>After a traumatic event it is common to feel &lsquo;wary&rsquo; and &lsquo;on guard&rsquo;, but some people who develop a condition called post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experience extreme fear that may persist for many years.</p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n',\n    file: 'IMG_2021125_101433.jpg',\n    thum_img: '',\n    type: 'image',\n    created_at: '2021-01-25T10:14:34.000Z',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 30,\n    topic: 'Emotions',\n    title: 'Understanding emotions',\n    description:\n      '<p>Another way of thinking about the effects of emotions is to sort them into problems of &lsquo;too much&rsquo;, &lsquo;too little&rsquo;, and &lsquo;too difficult to control&rsquo;:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>When we feel too much</strong></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>We might feel too scared in certain situations, or when confronted with certain things.

Given some of the news coverage, it would be hard not to worry about what it all means for yourself, and for those you love. Worry and anxiety&nbsp;are common problems at the best of times, and when it takes over, it can become all-encompassing.</span></p>\\n\\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>What is worry?</strong></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Human beings have the amazing ability to think about future events. &lsquo;Thinking ahead&rsquo; means that we can anticipate obstacles or problems, and gives us the opportunity to plan solutions. For example, hand washing and social distancing are helpful things that we can decide to do in order to prevent the spread of the virus. However, worrying is a way of &lsquo;thinking ahead&rsquo; that often leaves us feeling anxious or apprehensive. When we worry excessively, we often think about worst case scenarios and feel that we won&rsquo;t be able to cope.</span></p>\\n',\n    file: 'IMG_2020623_211651.jpg',\n    thum_img: '',\n    type: 'image',\n    created_at: '2020-06-23T21:17:04.000Z',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 24,\n    topic: 'Anxiety',\n    title: 'How to cope with worry',\n    description:\n      '<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">It is natural for you to worry at the moment, but if you feel that it&rsquo;s becoming excessive and taking over your life &ndash; for example if it&rsquo;s making you anxious, or if you&rsquo;re stuggling to sleep &ndash; then it might be worth trying to find ways to limit the time you spend worrying, and taking steps to manage your well-being. Included is a selection of tips that can help you maintain your well-being and manage your worry. These can help you to:</span></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Maintain balance in your life.</strong> Psychologists think that well-being comes from living a life with a balance of activities that give you feelings of pleasure, achievement, and closeness. Remember that we&rsquo;re social animals &ndash; we need connections to thrive and flourish. We would recommend trying to do at least some activities that are social and involve other people. In times like these you might have to find some creative ways to do social things at a distance. For example, by keeping in touch online or by phone.</span></li>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Practice identifying whether your worry is &lsquo;real problem&rsquo; worry, or &lsquo;hypothetical worry&rsquo;.</strong>&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re experiencing lots of hypothetical worry, then it&rsquo;s important to remind yourself that your mind is not focusing on a problem that you can solve right now, and then to find ways to let the worry go and focus on something else.</span></li>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Practice postponing your worry.</strong> Worry is insistent &ndash; it can make you feel as though you have to engage with it right now. But you can experiment with postponing hypothetical worry. In practice, this means deliberately setting aside time each day to let yourself worry (e.g. 30 minutes at the end of each day). It can feel like an odd thing to do at first! It also means that for the other 23.5 hours in the day you try to let go of the worry until you get to your &lsquo;worry time&rsquo;.</span></li>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Practice mindfulness.</strong> Learning and practicing mindfulness&nbsp;can help us to let go of worries and bring ourselves back to the present moment.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Final tips to help manage anxiety or worry</strong></span></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Set a routine.</strong> If you are spending more time at home it is important to continue with a regular routine.</span></li>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Stay mentally and physically active.</strong> When you plan your daily timetable have a go at including activities that keep both your mind and body active.</span></li>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Practice gratitude.</strong> At times of uncertainty, developing a gratitude practice can help you to connect with moments of joy, aliveness, and pleasure. At the end of each day take time to reflect on what you are thankful for today.</span></li>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Notice and limit worry triggers.</strong> As the health situation develops it can feel like we need to constantly follow the news or check social media for updates. However, you might notice this also triggers your worry and anxiety. Try to limit the time that you are exposed to worry triggers each day.</span></li>\\n\\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Rely on reputable news sources.</strong> It can also help to be mindful of where you are obtaining news and information.

Moreover, mindfulness during social interaction can involve speaking with awareness. Examples include pausing before speaking, monitoring one&rsquo;s thoughts, and considering the effect of speaking them out loud.

Most routine activities require little conscious attention because they are highly automatized. Examples include taking a shower, driving or walking to the workplace, or consuming lunch. The idea is to focus attention fully on the activity; the body movements, the sight, the sensations. When thoughts or other distractions emerge, one notices them and brings back attention to the task at hand. For instance, when eating mindfully, one eats slowly, directing attention mainly to the experience in the present moment, which includes physical movements, the taste and smell of the food, and the like. Thus, rather than doing multiple things at the same time (such as reading while eating, talking on the phone while driving home, thinking about work while taking a shower), one adopts a single focus of attention.</p>\\n\\n<p>As part of mindfulness training programs, participants are encouraged to pick a few of these routine activities and to practice performing them in a mindful way. Since it is not time-consuming and involves activities that are performed daily, this exercise can easily be implemented into one&rsquo;s workday. Participants may pick activities, such as being mindful while having lunch, being mindful while walking to the copy machine, or being mindful while driving home from work.</p>\\n',\n    file: 'IMG_2020615_101216.jpg',\n    thum_img: 'IMG_2020615_101217.jpg',\n    type: 'image',\n    created_at: '2020-06-15T09:41:51.000Z',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 5,\n    topic: 'Communication',\n    title: 'Effective Commuinication',\n    description:\n      '<p>Effective communication is about more than just exchanging information. It&rsquo;s about understanding the emotion and intentions behind the information. As well as being able to clearly convey a message, you need to also listen in a way that gains the full meaning of what&rsquo;s being said and makes the other person feel heard and understood.</p>\\n\\n<p>Effective communication sounds like it should be instinctive. But all too often, when we try to communicate with others something goes astray. We say one thing, the other person hears something else, and misunderstandings, frustration, and conflicts ensue. This can cause problems in your home, school, and work relationships.</p>\\n\\n<p>For many of us, communicating more clearly and effectively requires learning some important skills. Whether you&rsquo;re trying to improve communication with your spouse, kids, boss, or coworkers, learning these skills can deepen your connections to others, build greater trust and respect, and improve teamwork, problem solving, and your overall social and emotional health.</p>\\n',\n    file: 'IMG_2020615_95930.png',\n    thum_img: 'IMG_2020615_95931.png',\n    type: 'image',\n    created_at: '2020-04-21T11:40:50.000Z',\n  },\n];\n\nfunction groupByData(key, array) {\n  const result = [];\n  // eslint-disable-next-line no-plusplus\n  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    let added = false;\n    // eslint-disable-next-line no-plusplus\n    for (let j = 0; j < result.length; j++) {\n      if (result[j][key] === array[i][key]) {\n        result[j].items.push(array[i]);\n        added = true;\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    if (!added) {\n      const entry = { items: [] };\n      entry[key] = array[i][key];\n      entry.items.push(array[i]);\n      result.push(entry);\n    }\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n\nexport default function Library() {\n  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(0);\n\n  const handleChange = (event, newValue) => {\n    setValue(newValue);\n  };\n\n  const topics = groupByData('topic', library);\n  console.log(topics);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {/* <div className=\"loader\">\n        <img src=\"assets/img/loader.svg\" alt=\"loader\" />\n      </div> */}\n      <div className=\"inner_page\">\n        <h2 className=\"mb-3  border-bottom other_heading\">Library</h2>\n        <MenuTabs\n          indicatorColor=\"primary\"\n          variant=\"scrollable\"\n          scrollButtons=\"auto\"\n          value={value}\n          onChange={handleChange}\n          aria-label=\"simple tabs\">\n          {topics.map((item, index) => (\n            <MenuTab key={item.topic} label={item.topic} {...a11yProps(index)} />\n          ))}\n        </MenuTabs>\n        {topics.map((topic, index) => (\n          <TabPanel key={topic.topic} value={value} index={index}>\n            {topics[value].items.map((item) => (\n              <div className=\"col-md-4 col-lg-4 mb-3\">\n                <div className=\"blog-box\">\n                  <div className=\"blog-img\">\n                    <img src={`${topic.thum_img}`} alt=\"img\" />\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"blog-content\">\n                    <a href=\"#0\" routerLink=\"/library-detail/{{ itemData.id }}\">\n                      <h2>{item.title}</h2>\n                      <p>{item.description}</p>\n                    </a>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            ))}\n          </TabPanel>\n        ))}\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
