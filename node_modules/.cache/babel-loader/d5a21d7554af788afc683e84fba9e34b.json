Smell is one of our most primitive and powerful senses. The part of the brain that processes smel - called the olfactory bulb - is directly connected to the part of the brain that processes danger and emotion &ndash; called the amygdala. This means that smell is a very quick way of<br />\\naffecting our emotional responses.</p>\\n\\n<p>Different smells can serve different purposes. You may have already tried using a soothing smell to help to relax and calm yourself. If you are having a flashback though, and need to<br />\\ncome back to the present moment, then it is helpful to use a strong smell &ndash; for this purpose it does not even have to be a smell you like. To be useful, you will need to have the smell<br />\\nwith you wherever you go.</p>\\n\\n<p>The first step to grounding yourself with smell will be to pick a grounding smell. For this sensory grounding exercise we want to use a strong smell to bring you back to the present<br />\\nmoment. A great source of smells are the small bottles of essential oil which you can buy from a chemist or pharmacist. Other common sources of smells are natural herbs and<br />\\nspices, or perfumes. The strongest smells tend to be traditional smelling salts that contain ammonia. Other strong smells include eucalyptus, tea-tree, or mint.</p>\\n\\n<p>The instructions for this exercise will start in a moment.

The fight-or-flight response is an automatic bodily reaction which is designed to get our body ready to cope with danger.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of these changes is that our muscles tense to prepare for action. If there is a real danger this means that we are more ready to run away from a danger at a moment&rsquo;s notice or, if we can&rsquo;t run, then we are ready to fight. This is called the fight or flight reaction.</p>\\n\\n<p>Unfortunately what we know is that when we have PTSD our fight-or-flight reaction is too sensitive - it often goes off even when there is no danger. Progressive muscle relaxation is a great way to correct this unhelpful reaction of the fight or- flight response.

Sometimes we can feel that sense of wanting to move on to the next moment, wanting it to be over.

One of the ways we can practice mindfulness is to place our attention in our bodies. Much of the time, we can be so &lsquo;stuck in our head&rsquo; that we feel disconnected from our bodies, even though they are with us all the time. The body scan exercise helps us learn to feel more connected, by using the body as an anchor for our attention. So the purpose of the body scan is to have an introduction to sensing and feeling, rather than thinking.</p>\\n\\n<p>During this exercise you can imagine that your attention is a spotlight that illuminates different parts of the body as you shift your focus. As the light shines on a particular<br />\\npart, notice the feeling that comes up, whether it&rsquo;s a warmth, a tingling sensation, or even nothing at all. Not so much thinking about what&rsquo;s there, but just feeling it.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nRemember: your attitude in these exercises is to bring an open curiosity and interest. There&rsquo;s no right or wrong, your intention is just to notice whatever is there. And it&rsquo;s OK if<br />\\nthere is no particular sensation &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have to go searching or think about it.</p>\\n\\n<p>This exercise will take about ten to twelve minutes, and you will be guided where to focus<br />\\nyour attention throughout. Just feel whatever comes up. Sooner or later your mind will wander; whenever that happens, remember that&rsquo;s OK, and that&rsquo;s normal. If you notice<br />\\nsensations that are painful or uncomfortable then at those moments you have a choice about whether to pay attention to parts of your body that feel more comfortable, or to the<br />\\ninstructions of the body scan.

This<br />\\n&lsquo;works&rsquo; for some things in our lives &ndash; think about how you avoid foods you don&rsquo;t like. And<br />\\nsometimes we try to do the same with our feelings &ndash; unpleasantness might come up and<br />\\nwe try to avoid it. But even if you keep pushing it away, it&rsquo;s like a boomerang and it just<br />\\ncomes back. And sometimes that struggle of pushing things away, and being distressed<br />\\nthat they don&rsquo;t stay away, can be distressing.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nOne way of thinking about this is to think about the difference between pain and suffering.<br />\\nWe can think of the thing we don&rsquo;t like as &lsquo;pain&rsquo; &ndash; and it&rsquo;s understandable and unavoidable<br />\\nto experience dislike and &lsquo;pain&rsquo; in our lives.

Mindfulness is one way of helping us to learn how to<br />\\nunhook from these difficult thoughts and feelings.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nInterestingly, human beings can be really good at unhooking from sounds. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve<br />\\nbeen in a busy place, like a caf&eacute;, and tuned out sounds around you when you&rsquo;ve been tuned<br />\\nin to a conversation with a friend.

Smell is one of our most primitive and powerful senses. The part of the brain that processes smel - called the olfactory bulb - is directly connected to the part of the brain that processes danger and emotion &ndash; called the amygdala. This means that smell is a very quick way of<br />\\naffecting our emotional responses.</p>\\n\\n<p>Different smells can serve different purposes. You may have already tried using a soothing smell to help to relax and calm yourself. If you are having a flashback though, and need to<br />\\ncome back to the present moment, then it is helpful to use a strong smell &ndash; for this purpose it does not even have to be a smell you like. To be useful, you will need to have the smell<br />\\nwith you wherever you go.</p>\\n\\n<p>The first step to grounding yourself with smell will be to pick a grounding smell. For this sensory grounding exercise we want to use a strong smell to bring you back to the present<br />\\nmoment. A great source of smells are the small bottles of essential oil which you can buy from a chemist or pharmacist. Other common sources of smells are natural herbs and<br />\\nspices, or perfumes. The strongest smells tend to be traditional smelling salts that contain ammonia. Other strong smells include eucalyptus, tea-tree, or mint.</p>\\n\\n<p>The instructions for this exercise will start in a moment. Pause this recording and go andfind a grounding smell now.</p>\\n',\n    type: 'audio',\n    file: 'IMG_2021414_84636.mp3',\n    thum_img: 'IMG_2021414_84633.jpg',\n    created_at: '2021-04-14T08:46:40.000Z',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 37,\n    title: 'Progressive Muscle Relaxation',\n    description:\n      '<p>When we are feeling threatened or scared our body goes through a number of changes in an effort to keep us safe. The fight-or-flight response is an automatic bodily reaction which is designed to get our body ready to cope with danger.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of these changes is that our muscles tense to prepare for action. If there is a real danger this means that we are more ready to run away from a danger at a moment&rsquo;s notice or, if we can&rsquo;t run, then we are ready to fight. This is called the fight or flight reaction.</p>\\n\\n<p>Unfortunately what we know is that when we have PTSD our fight-or-flight reaction is too sensitive - it often goes off even when there is no danger. Progressive muscle relaxation is a great way to correct this unhelpful reaction of the fight or- flight response. Deliberately relaxing the muscles in the body signals to the mind that you are safe, that there is no danger, and that you are safe to relax once again.</p>\\n',\n    type: 'audio',\n    file: 'IMG_2021414_8409.mp3',\n    thum_img: 'IMG_2021414_8407.jpg',\n    created_at: '2021-04-14T08:40:25.000Z',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 36,\n    title: 'Mindfulness of Breath',\n    description:\n      '<p>Different things can happen when we practice mindfulness for longer periods. We might notice more sensations, such as boredom or mind wandering, and that&rsquo;s completely normal<br />\\nand OK. In fact, that&rsquo;s a part of why we&rsquo;re doing this &ndash; so let&rsquo;s have a go a practicing with that. The purpose of the exercise is to practice a longer mindfulness of breath, and see<br />\\nwhat comes up.

Practice experiencing each breath as a new breath, as if you hadn&rsquo;t felt the one before. Really noticing how it&rsquo;s moving all of your parts of your body. Everyone&#39;s different &ndash; some people find it relaxing, and others notice boredom or irritation, or impatience arising. Sometimes we can feel that sense of wanting to move on to the next moment, wanting it to be over. And these moments are an opportunity to notice that we&rsquo;re having a reaction to the neutralness or indifference of that moment. With mindfulness can we reconnect with our sense of interest and curiosity with this moment, with this breath, and these body sensations?</p>\\n',\n    type: 'audio',\n    file: 'IMG_2021414_83632.mp3',\n    thum_img: 'IMG_2021414_83626.jpg',\n    created_at: '2021-04-14T08:37:34.000Z',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 35,\n    title: 'Grounding Objects',\n    description:\n      '<p>Grounding objects are another form of sensory grounding.

One of the ways we can practice mindfulness is to place our attention in our bodies. Much of the time, we can be so &lsquo;stuck in our head&rsquo; that we feel disconnected from our bodies, even though they are with us all the time. The body scan exercise helps us learn to feel more connected, by using the body as an anchor for our attention. So the purpose of the body scan is to have an introduction to sensing and feeling, rather than thinking.</p>\\n\\n<p>During this exercise you can imagine that your attention is a spotlight that illuminates different parts of the body as you shift your focus. As the light shines on a particular<br />\\npart, notice the feeling that comes up, whether it&rsquo;s a warmth, a tingling sensation, or even nothing at all. Not so much thinking about what&rsquo;s there, but just feeling it.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nRemember: your attitude in these exercises is to bring an open curiosity and interest. There&rsquo;s no right or wrong, your intention is just to notice whatever is there. And it&rsquo;s OK if<br />\\nthere is no particular sensation &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have to go searching or think about it.</p>\\n\\n<p>This exercise will take about ten to twelve minutes, and you will be guided where to focus<br />\\nyour attention throughout. Just feel whatever comes up. Sooner or later your mind will wander; whenever that happens, remember that&rsquo;s OK, and that&rsquo;s normal. If you notice<br />\\nsensations that are painful or uncomfortable then at those moments you have a choice about whether to pay attention to parts of your body that feel more comfortable, or to the<br />\\ninstructions of the body scan. Take care of what feels OK for you and work within the limits of your own body.</p>\\n',\n    type: 'audio',\n    file: 'IMG_2021414_82513.mp3',\n    thum_img: 'IMG_2021414_82510.jpg',\n    created_at: '2021-04-14T08:25:30.000Z',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 33,\n    title: 'Recovering from a nightmare',\n    description:\n      '<p>Many people with PTSD have frequent nightmares.

It&rsquo;s most often practiced<br />\\nwith a raisin, but it will work equally well with a substitution of another piece of dried<br />\\nfruit, a nut, or even a piece of chocolate. Try and find somewhere quiet, where you won&rsquo;t<br />\\nbe disturbed.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nThe second is that the purpose of this exercise is to experience something through our<br />\\nsenses rather than our thinking mind &ndash; to really taste, smell, and sense the raisin rather<br />\\nthan thinking about it.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nThe third is a quick reminder of the &lsquo;mindset&rsquo; or attitude that it&rsquo;s helpful to bring. Pay<br />\\nattention to the raisin as though you had never seen or eaten something like this before.<br />\\nBringing an interest and curiosity to the experience. Remember, there&rsquo;s no right or wrong,<br />\\nand you don&rsquo;t have to like or dislike it. Just be curious and notice what happens.<br />\\nWe&rsquo;ll start the exercise in a moment.

This<br />\\n&lsquo;works&rsquo; for some things in our lives &ndash; think about how you avoid foods you don&rsquo;t like. And<br />\\nsometimes we try to do the same with our feelings &ndash; unpleasantness might come up and<br />\\nwe try to avoid it. But even if you keep pushing it away, it&rsquo;s like a boomerang and it just<br />\\ncomes back. And sometimes that struggle of pushing things away, and being distressed<br />\\nthat they don&rsquo;t stay away, can be distressing.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nOne way of thinking about this is to think about the difference between pain and suffering.<br />\\nWe can think of the thing we don&rsquo;t like as &lsquo;pain&rsquo; &ndash; and it&rsquo;s understandable and unavoidable<br />\\nto experience dislike and &lsquo;pain&rsquo; in our lives. Then we think of the struggle with our pain as<br />\\nthe suffering. And the suffering results from &lsquo;trying to get rid of &rsquo; the unpleasant experience.<br />\\nOne thing that we&rsquo;re practicing with mindfulness is to ask the question &ldquo;Can we sit<br />\\nwith difficulty, and try and bring friendliness and curiosity to it?&rdquo;.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nSo in this exercise, your intention is to spend about ten minutes &lsquo;being with&rsquo; a difficulty.<br />\\nWe&rsquo;re going to treat it like an experiment. We&rsquo;re going to take a curious stance: we&rsquo;re<br />\\nnot trying to achieve anything. Instead of reacting to the distressing thing in a typical<br />\\nunhelpful way, we&rsquo;re going to see how we might be with it in a more friendly way.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nObviously, we don&rsquo;t want to choose something that&rsquo;s a ten out of ten distressing, so perhaps<br />\\nchoose a minor disagreement, or something that&rsquo;s been niggling away at you for a while.<br />\\nAnd we&rsquo;re going to ask the question &ldquo;what&rsquo;s it like to just be with this?&rdquo;.

Mindfulness is one way of helping us to learn how to<br />\\nunhook from these difficult thoughts and feelings.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nInterestingly, human beings can be really good at unhooking from sounds. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve<br />\\nbeen in a busy place, like a caf&eacute;, and tuned out sounds around you when you&rsquo;ve been tuned<br />\\nin to a conversation with a friend. It&#39;s only when there&rsquo;s a pause in the conversation that<br />\\nyou become aware of all the noise around you.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nEqually, sounds can be really good at hooking us in: imagine you&rsquo;re watching tv and some<br />\\npeople start making noise outside. It can be hard, but not impossible, to unhook from that<br />\\nnoise.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\nThe point is that we can consider sounds &ndash; like thoughts &ndash; as sensations that come and<br />\\ngo. Learning to hear sounds as &lsquo;just sounds&rsquo; can help us to experience our thoughts as &lsquo;just<br />\\nthoughts&rsquo;. In this exercise, your intention is to spend about 10 minutes noticing sounds and<br />\\nthoughts. Like all of our exercises, we&rsquo;re not trying to &lsquo;achieve&rsquo; anything, we&rsquo;re spending<br />\\ntime experiencing these sensations.

The Three Minute Breathing Space exercise can be used as an effective practice to integrate mindfulness into daily life. A structural implementation of the exercise can be achieved by using a timer at fixed moments during the day. In this way, the exercise can become automatized. NB: During this exercise, your attention might get distracted by certain thoughts or feelings. Simply notice this. You can decide to observe these thoughts and feelings for a while and then return your attention to your breath or your body. Instructions: The exercise consists of 3 sections (1 minute per section):</span></p>\\n\\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">1. Awareness: Ask yourself the question: How am I doing right now? Focus your attention on your inner perception. Notice which thoughts, feelings and physical sensations you are experiencing. Try to translate your experiences into words. For example: &ldquo;there are self-critical thoughts&rdquo; or &ldquo;I notice I am tensed&rdquo;. What are you feeling in your body? Allow yourself to feel what you are feeling in the current moment. Accept it. You can tell yourself that it&rsquo;s okay what you&rsquo;re feeling, whatever is there is fine just the way it is.</span></p>\\n\\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">2. Breathing: Next focus your full attention on your breath. Follow the breathing with your attention.</span></p>\\n\\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">3. Expansion of attention: Allow your attention to expand to the rest of your body. Feel how your breath moves throughout your whole body.
